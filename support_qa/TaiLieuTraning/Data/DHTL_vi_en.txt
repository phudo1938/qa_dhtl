Appendix 2. Steps to create a timetable
Step 1: Based on the overall plan and training program of each learner, make a plan to organize the course plan for the school year (especially the elective courses), specifically:
◦ List of subjects expected to open;
◦ Number of management classes and corresponding number of students expected to study;
◦ Arrange the management class plan: study time (Morning/Afternoon study), on the principle of trying to arrange a gap between two adjacent courses and adjacent semesters;
◦ Make a corresponding lesson plan: Study plan (Phase 1/Phase 2/Full semester), Corresponding lesson for the main subjects to be learned.
Step 2: Send to the departments for comments and requests to provide more information about the modules, receive and process comments, if any. This step takes place 6 weeks before starting school.
Step 3: Plan the class, specifically.
◦ Create a section class:
▪ For courses with only Theory or Theory and practice exercises (still held in the normal lecture hall):
• Create a section class for a management class if the management class has 50 students or more.
• Priority is given to combining 2 or more management classes (with similar subject plans) into one section class for classes with less than 50 students, but ensure the total class size does not exceed about 70 students.
• In case it is not possible to follow the above two options, create 01 class for 01 management class.
▪ For Project Project modules: average 40 students/class. For a management class with a population of ≥ 60 students, it is divided into 02 part classes. Otherwise, organize a partial class.
▪ For Experimental modules: divide classes according to laboratory conditions and subject specifics according to the School's own regulations.
▪ For Practice modules: divide classes according to module characteristics.
▪ For Physical Education courses: organized not according to major classes but for students to register freely. The department, based on field conditions, teaching staff and the number of students, proposes the number of courses and classes (average 50 students/class). The Training Department organizes according to the proposal of the department.
▪ For English courses: organized not according to major classes but for students to register freely. Based on the number of students and the conditions that require the course, predict the number of students eligible to study, thereby creating the number of course classes (average 35-40 students/class).
▪ For information technology subjects that use computer labs for practice:
The theoretical part is taught in the lecture hall, the practical part is taught in the computer lab. Allocate the amount of time for theory and practice according to the detailed outline approved in the training program.
◦ Make a detailed plan for the class: start date, end date, class, number of periods/week...
Step 4: Send to departments for comments and teaching assignments; Receive information and exchange and discuss to resolve opinions (if any). This step usually takes place 4 weeks before starting school.
Step 5: Update the Instructor assignment for each class.

◦ Arranged classes ensure a minimum number of planned and arranged periods of 2-3 periods/session, 2-4 sessions/week; Priority for starting classes is the same, limiting consecutive classes on school days;
◦ Classes keep plans stable during the period;
◦ Module classes are arranged into classrooms that match the specific characteristics of the module with the classroom capacity and expected class size. Priority is given to different study sessions during the week in the same classroom. If different classrooms are required, priority is given to arranging rooms close together;
◦ Resolve conflicts regarding Lecturers for assigned classes that have overlapping schedules or conflicts with the Lecturer's requirements in principle while still ensuring the above criteria;

Step 3: Consider students' wishes (registration for students who have registered their wishes), according to priority level: old courses have priority over new courses, re-studying has priority over studying to improve scores and not having studied...
Step 4: Organize registration for different courses (retake, improve grades, pass the same previous course, repeat the same course, take different management classes) after step 3:
◦ Receive applications to handle special cases that cannot operate the software themselves (graduated from first degree, students registered at different training facilities or other special cases...);
◦ Monitor the registration process, balance class sizes to match the progress of the registration process;
◦ This step takes place 02 times in 01 week right before starting the learning phase (once before starting phase 1 and once before starting phase 2);
Step 5: Review student registration data
◦ Cancel or combine classes with a large number of registered students:
▪ Less than 20 students/class (except for practical, experimental, and specialized knowledge sections of majors with few students). Special cases are considered and decided by the Board of Directors or authorized by the Head of the Training Department to decide.
◦ Separate some theory classes with over-enrolled numbers.
◦ Notify relevant departments and students to coordinate implementation
◦ This step is done right before starting to study;
